# Big Muff Pi Clone
My first KiCAD schematic/PCB. A clone of the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi fuzz/overdrive pedal.

Throughout this project I'll learn:
- How to use KiCAD for schematic capture and layout
- How to add new part footprints/symbols in KiCAD
- How to use KiCAD's built-in SPICE to simulate circuits
- How to lay out a board
- How expensive components are

And hopefully have fun along the way!
